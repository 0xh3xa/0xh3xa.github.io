I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science, specializing in researching malware detection using Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and other AI categories. My online alias is `0xh3xa`, and this blog serves as a record of my journey in cybersecurity, detailing projects, and providing various HOWTOs related to security.

Iâ€™m passionate about Cyber Security and Lower-level programming, OS Kernel, UEFI programming, Software Engineering/Development. Since Reverse Engineering, Exploit Development, and Malware Analysis are at the intersection of Software Engineering/Development, I decided to start security endeavors on these aspects.

Previously I was working as a software engineer involved in full-stack development and cloud activities. However, I found myself bogged down by monotonous and repetitive tasks, lacking the excitement and depth I craved from core computer science concepts like OS kernel, database engines, optimizations, etc. This led me to redirect my interests towards security, low-level programming, and crafting solutions/services for developers. I discovered immense joy in delving into security, and operating systems, constantly learning and exploring new things. I started my journey in security and low-level and this blog to record my journey and other cool stuff. 

My skills encompass expertise in Reverse Engineering, Exploit Development, Malware Analysis, as well as proficiency in tools such as IDA Pro, Ghidra, x64Dbg, GDB, JADX, and many more.

I am well-versed in programming languages including Assembly, Java, Python, C, Node.js, PHP. I have hand-on cloud including AWS, Google Cloud (GCP). I am currently expanding my knowledge in Mobile Penetration Testing. Additionally, I possess solid hands-on experience in Linux administration and engineering.

### What is UPX packer?

UPX is an open-source, free, secure, portable, extendable, high-performance executable packer for several executable formats.

The purpose of the packer is to reduce the file size of programs and DLLs reducing disk space, network load times, download times, and other distribution and storage costs.  More info https://upx.github.io

In addition to UPX packer, other packers could be commercials and close sources exist like ASpack, ASProtect, AutoIT, DarkCrypt, AvPack, and many more.

### How to pack the sample using the UPX packer?

You can download it from the GitHub repo [https://github.com/upx/upx/releases](https://github.com/upx/upx/releases) and select the appropriate one for your operating system.

After you download the UPX, you can open the Unix-like systems terminal or Windows command prompt (cmd).

Open the terminal  and type 

```shell
up --help
```

I have a small C program that prints "Hello World!" with the name "hello.c" and I want to use the UPX to pack it.

First I will compile it and output the exe file, using the following command, I am using the MS VC compiler, more info: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/compiler-options?view=msvc-170#find-a-compiler-option](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/compiler-options?view=msvc-170#find-a-compiler-option)

```console
cl -o 
```

After that, I will pack the sample using the following command

```shell
upx hello.exe -o hello-packed.exe 
```

### Compare the packed vs. unpacked sample

Let's see the file size and Portable Executable (PE) metadata of unpacked compared to packed files.

![loading image](/assets/images/posts/reversing/unpack-upx/compile.png)

Now I open the two files with PeStudio for PE analyzing, let's move to sections and imports.

![loading image](/assets/images/posts/reversing/unpack-upx/iat.png)

As shown in the image below the packed has different section names (UPX0, UPX1, .rsrc) unlike the unpacked one (.text,.data, .rdata).


### How to identify the UPX packing exists?

Different tools help you to identify the packer exist one of them Detect-it-easy and PeID tools.

Here Detect-it-easy identify it and PeID

, But what are general things to keep in consideration when identifying the packer exists:

1. Entropy value (entropy is a value that measures the randomness and compression), if you check the entropy value of some sections you will find it `>=7.0`  compared with others which unpacked with `<7.0`

2. Sections' names, the default for the compiler to use `.text`, `.data`, `.rdata`, etc. But in UPX case there are `UPX0`, `UPX1`, etc.

3. The raw size compared with the virtual size, in the case of the UPX you will find that the raw size is `0` or much less than the virtual size.

4. Checking the imports with PeStudio or CFF-Explorer, you will find fewer functions are referenced.

5. Tail jump, which is used by the stub to jump to the virtual address at the unpacked entry point. This tail jump you will identify if you open the sample into the IDA disassembler, there is no existing `ret` instruction.

### How to unpack the UPX sample?

Two options are using the command line and other manually using the xDbg debugger.

Let's start by using the command line first

```shell
upx -d hello-packed.exe --o hello-unpacked.exe
```

Now let's start by using it manually using the xDbg debugger, I will open xDbg64 as the sample is 64-bit

Moving to the breakpoints tab, you will find breakpoints at the `ntdll.dll` and entry point of the sample, press `F9` to run and stop at the entry points.

Find the tail jump that could be found using the Graph by pressing `g` and scrolling down until find it or by converting the address from IDA into xDbg.

![loading image](/assets/images/posts/reversing/unpack-upx/jmp.png)

Once you find it, press `F2` to create a breakpoint then run `F8` for stepping over and continue running. The breakpoint will hit press `F7` to step into.

Click on the dump or just right-click and move to the memory location you will find that you are at `UPX0` now.

At this point you are the address of the entry point of the sample, there are different methods to extract the dump. The easiest one using the `Scylla` plugin in xDbg debugger by click on Plugins -> Scylla

Scylla is a good plugin to extract dump from the memory location, there are other tools called 

Here I am using Scylla, the Window is showing. 
It points to the address of the entry point which we are stop there. Click on  IAT auto search, imports, and dump.

At the points there are some missing in the alignments, rather than do it manually you can use Scylla by clicking Fix dump which will extract dump_SCY.

![loading image](/assets/images/posts/reversing/unpack-upx/scylla.png)


Open the dump_SCY using the IDA and check the imports tab and the graph view, here is the call for the `printf()` function and print `Hello World!`

If you now check the import functions you will see more referenced functions.

I am a Master's degree in Computer Science, specializing in researching malware detection using Deep Learning and Machine Learning. My online alias is `0xh3xa`, and this blog serves as a record of my journey in cybersecurity and projects.

I’m passionate about Cyber Security and Lower-level, OS Kernel, Software Engineering/Development. Since Reverse Engineering, Exploit Development, and Malware Analysis are at the intersection of Software Engineering/Development, I decided to start security endeavors on these aspects.

Previously I was working as a software engineer involved in full-stack development and cloud activities. However, I found myself bogged down by monotonous and repetitive tasks, lacking the excitement and depth I craved from core computer science concepts like OS kernel, database engines, optimizations, etc. This led me to redirect my interests towards security, low-level programming, and crafting solutions/services for developers. I discovered immense joy in delving into security, and operating systems, constantly learning and exploring new things. I started my journey in security and low-level and this blog to record my journey.

My skills encompass expertise in Penetration Testing, Reverse Engineering, Malware Analysis, as well as proficiency in tools such as `IDA Pro`, `Ghidra`, `x64Dbg`, `gdb`, `jadx`, etc.

I am well-versed in programming languages including `x86 Assembly`, `Java`, `Python`, `C`, `Node.js`, `PHP`. I have hand-on cloud including `AWS` and `Google Cloud (GCP)`. I am currently expanding my knowledge in Penetration Testing.
